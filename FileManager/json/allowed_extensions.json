/*
Here is an example of the `json` file you can do.
This file is only an example but it's used as a default file
for the \FileManager\Methods\Upload by default.

Of course, only the values (not keys) will get fetch from this file.
Because of that, you can create many objects, but only values will
get kept by the program.
